WAVES

The task of this project is to make a quick hacksprint project in C++ for the "waves" prompt.

This is a demo game called "Waves of Trash" and it is a deserted island rescue made using ncurses and pulseaudio's paplay program.

The goal of the game is to collect the trash on the beach, and then burn it when a ship is spotted, in hopes of rescue.
